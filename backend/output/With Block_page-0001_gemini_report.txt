EXPLANATIONS:
*   **W1:** Located on the far left of the Elevation View, this callout specifies an all-around fillet weld joining PIPE 60.3x3.6 1 to the vertical end plate, Part 9. The symbol shows a triangle on the arrow side of the reference line with a '4' for a 4 mm fillet size. The circle at the junction of the arrow and reference line indicates the weld is to be applied all around the joint. 'TYP' indicates this is a typical weld.
*   **W2:** Found in the 'B11-B11' section view on the left side. This callout has two leader lines pointing to the joints between the vertical web (Part 24) and both the top flange (Part 19) and bottom flange (Part 22). The symbol is a single triangle on the arrow side with a '3', indicating a 3 mm fillet weld on one side for both joints. 'TYP' is noted.
*   **W3:** Also in the 'B11-B11' section view, this is a separate callout on the right side, identical to W2. It specifies a 3 mm fillet weld joining the vertical web (Part 24) to the top (Part 19) and bottom (Part 22) flanges. 'TYP' is noted.
*   **W4:** Located on the bottom left of the Elevation View. The symbol indicates a 6 mm double fillet weld (triangles on both sides of the reference line) joining the vertical stiffener (Part 7) to the bottom plate (PL8 7). 'TYP.' is noted.
*   **W5:** Located on the left side of the Elevation View. The symbol specifies a 6 mm fillet weld (single triangle) joining the angled plate (Part 25) to the main vertical web (PL10 22). 'TYP.' is noted.
*   **W6:** Located at the top, left of center in the Elevation View. This callout specifies a 3 mm double fillet weld (triangles on both sides) joining the vertical stiffener (Part 3) to the top flange of the beam. The 'M' in the tail of the symbol indicates a machining requirement, and 'TYP' is also present.
*   **W7:** Located near W6 at the top, left of center. This callout specifies a 5 mm double fillet weld joining the vertical stiffener (Part 4) to the top flange. It also has 'TYP' and an 'M' in the tail.
*   **W8:** This callout points to an internal stiffener (Part 13) inside the beam structure, left of center. It specifies a 3 mm double fillet weld to the web plate (PL10 16). It includes 'TYP' and an 'M' in the tail.
*   **W9:** Located at the bottom, left of center, marked 'OF DRIVE'. This specifies a 6.3 mm fillet weld (single triangle) joining the support plate (Part 30) to the bottom flange. It is marked 'OF DRIVE TYP' and has an 'M' in the tail.
*   **W10:** Located at the top center of the Elevation View. This callout specifies a 5 mm double fillet weld joining the vertical stiffener (Part 28) to the top flange. It has 'TYP' and an 'M' in the tail.
*   **W11:** This callout points to an internal stiffener (Part 11) in the center of the beam. It specifies a 3 mm double fillet weld to the web plate (PL10 20). It includes 'TYP' and an 'M' in the tail.
*   **W12:** Located at the bottom center of the Elevation View. This specifies a 10 mm fillet weld (single triangle) joining the support plate (Part 31) to the bottom flange. It has 'TYP' and an 'M' in the tail.
*   **W13:** Located at the top, right of center, marked 'OF MOTOR'. This callout specifies a 4 mm double fillet weld joining the vertical stiffener (Part 26) to the top flange. It has 'OF MOTOR' and an 'M' in the tail.
*   **W14:** This callout points to an internal stiffener (Part 8) inside the beam, right of center. It specifies a 3 mm double fillet weld to the web plate (PL10 17). It includes 'TYP.' and an 'M' in the tail.
*   **W15:** Located at the bottom, right of center, marked 'OF MOTOR'. This specifies a 6.3 mm fillet weld (single triangle) joining the support plate (Part 32) to the bottom flange. The location is noted as 'OF MOTOR'.
*   **W16:** Located at the top far right of the Elevation View. This callout specifies a 4 mm double fillet weld joining the vertical stiffener (Part 2) to the top flange. It has an 'M' in the tail.
*   **W17:** Located at the bottom far right of the Elevation View. This callout specifies a 4 mm double fillet weld joining the vertical stiffener (Part 2) to the bottom flange. It has an 'M' in the tail.
*   **W18:** This callout points to an internal stiffener (Part 8) on the right side of the beam. It specifies a 3 mm double fillet weld to the web plate (PL10 23). It includes 'TYP.' and an 'M' in the tail.
*   **W19:** Located at the bottom far right of the Elevation View. This callout specifies a 3 mm double fillet weld joining the vertical stiffener (Part 3) to the bottom flange. It has 'TYP' and an 'M' in the tail.
*   **W20:** Located on the far right of the Elevation View, this is a second callout identical to W1. It specifies an all-around 4 mm fillet weld joining PIPE 60.3x3.6 1 to the vertical end plate, Part 9. 'TYP' indicates this is a typical weld.
