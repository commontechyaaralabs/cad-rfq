  "explanations": "A total of 35 individual weld symbols were identified across the 'ELEVATION VIEW' and the 'B11-B11' section view. Each symbol was sequentially numbered and analyzed. The analysis includes welds for various components such as pipes, flanges, web plates, stiffeners, and gussets. Welding types are predominantly Double Fillet Welds in the main elevation and single Fillet Welds in the section view, with one instance of a Fillet Weld All Around. Sizes range from 3mm to 10mm. Several welds are marked as 'TYP' (Typical), indicating the specification applies to other similar, un-annotated joints. Annotations like 'OF DRIVE', 'OF MOTOR', and 'M' in the weld tail have been recorded exactly as shown. The high number of repetitive callouts for the web-to-flange welds (W9-W16) emphasizes the continuous nature of this critical joint."
