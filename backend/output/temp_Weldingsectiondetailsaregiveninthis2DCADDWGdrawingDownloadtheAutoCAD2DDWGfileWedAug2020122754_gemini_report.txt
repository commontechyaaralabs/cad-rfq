  "explanations": "W1: A weld callout in 'SECTION P-P' points to the T-joint between the MC200 component and the APH MODULE. The symbol indicates a double fillet weld (triangles on both sides of the reference line), with a leg size of 8 mm for each fillet. The note '(AT 2 PLACES)' indicates this weld configuration is present in two locations. A flag symbol (circle with '1') is also present.\nW2: A weld callout in 'SECTION N-N' points to the T-joint between the MB150 component and the APH MODULE. The symbol specifies a double fillet weld (triangles on both sides of the reference line), with a leg size of 8 mm for each fillet. The note '(AT 2 PLACES)' indicates this weld configuration is present in two locations. A flag symbol (circle with '1') is also present.\nW3: In 'SECTION N-N', a weld symbol points to the corner joint between the top flange of the MB150 beam and the U/S PLTF. (underside platform). The symbol is a single fillet weld on the arrow side. The size of the fillet weld is not specified on the callout. A flag symbol (circle with '1') is present, which typically refers to a general note not provided in this drawing.\nW4: In 'SECTION N-N', a leader line with two arrowheads points to the stiffener plate connections. One arrowhead indicates the weld at the T-joint between the vertical stiffener plate and the U/S PLTF.. The symbol specifies a single fillet weld on the arrow side. The size is not specified, and a flag symbol (circle with '1') is present.\nW5: This weld is indicated by the second arrowhead of the same leader line as W4 in 'SECTION N-N'. It points to the T-joint between the vertical stiffener plate and the web of the MB150 beam. The governing symbol is the same as for W4: a single fillet weld on the arrow side, with an unspecified size and a flag symbol (circle with '1').\nW6: This weld is detailed in the 'WELDING DETAIL' view, which is referenced by DETAIL-1 in 'SECTION M-M'. It describes the weld joining a '16THK. PLATE' to a 'BEAM FLANGE'. The symbol indicates a combination weld: a single bevel groove weld on the arrow side and a backing fillet weld on the other side. The groove weld requires a 38° bevel on the plate, a 2 mm root opening, and is to be ground flush on the top side. The backing fillet weld has a specified leg size of 6 mm. A flag symbol (1)(1) is associated with this weld."
